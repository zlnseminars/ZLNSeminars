										<h4>How Did I Get Here?: The Journey to Authenticity and Identity</h4>
										<p>We all have a story, about ourselves and our families. We all have a story. Now the only thing about that story is whether or not it’s true. Now, I do understand that truth deals with a matter of perception but we all have a true story. We filter our stories based upon our audience... if it’s close friends or family we may share the real and raw details. However, if it’s someone we are not as acquainted with we may sugar coat or filter it through a rose tinted lens. This is probably because a) we don’t know them so well and b) we want them to have a certain perception of us or I should say we want to control their perception of us. </p>
										<p>Well that’s not how I’m going to share my story. As young people we often don’t have people we can talk to and be real and honest with... we can’t just be ourselves. Not only because the world we live in, but also the parameter of authenticity is tainted by rules and regulations; such as you can be you just not in a way that makes others uncomfortable. Also, because we don’t truly know ourselves...our true selves; outside of the facades and the masks and the false narratives we tell our selves and others.</p>
										<p>How do we come to know our true selves? Well I certainly don’t have all the answers but, I do know some of the first steps to answering that question: How did I get here? The Bible states “We overcome by the blood of the Lamb[Christ] and the word of our testimony” (Revelation 12:11). </p>
										<p>The word “testimony” is our story. Our true story. The real and the raw details of our lives up until the point we are at now. Most never share their testimony for many reasons. One main reason might be the fear of what others may think of them. As I mentioned in my last post, fear is a false premonition... a block that keeps us from making forward progress. Testimonies are not so much about us and our comfort. Sharing our testimony is great in helping others know they are not alone and similarly that they too can and will overcome. So here we go... the truth, the real, and the raw. </p>
										<p>My journey in this life so far has had its ups and downs. I grew up as a child who was very demanding because I knew what I wanted, or so I thought. The problem was that what I wanted didn’t always match up with who I truly was/am. I was constantly trying to fit in. I never wanted to admit and accept my difference. I desired not to be “alone” or an “outcast.” I wanted that big group of friends and I wanted that fellowship but what was I willing to do to accomplish that? I was young and wanted what society portrayed as having the best life for a young person. Friends, family, latest fashion and tech... the works. That’s the best life according to society. And that’s a lie. That’s not the best life. With that desire and downright desperation to fit in and attain that, I engaged in things I didn’t think would have had some serious consequences. Something in me (Intuition) deep down inside knew  I was not meant to fit in but I, being spiritually immature at the time, ignored it. That dissonance manifested itself in the form of me traveling between friend groups. I was searching for myself in each one, trying to fill that void of not knowing who I was until finally I decided to stop searching in people and turned to the virtual world. A key aspect in that void I was feeling was that I did not love myself. I wanted to be loved by people. How can people love you if you don’t love yourself? Better yet how do you know they are loving you if don’t how to love yourself or what love is? </p>
										<p>I decided ok well since they can’t give me what I desire, let’s see if I can find it online. That’s when pornography came into the picture. I had ventured into the adult film world as a viewer not a participator to fill that void. I thought they seem to be enjoying themselves that must be what loving yourself is. I would retreat to my room and relieve all the pressures of my day through pornography. At this time I’m in middle school so that’s the pubescent age range. I didn’t have friends per se to talk to so I would “talk” through porn. I would relieve myself and believe that all had been taken care of and all is well with the world and onto the next, right? Wrong!</p>

										<p>This turned into a few years of addiction because I saw no other outlet to “fill” that void. I use air quotes because you can’t fill that void with external things. The external pleasures only numbs it so you can I guess function throughout the day/week/month/year. In this time of my life I had also been dealing with self image issues. That’s not so surprising seeing that I had yet to discover my true beauty and tap into the love that God has for me and since people weren’t giving me what I wanted I figured there must be something wrong with me . I was overweight. I had turned to food as a coping mechanism to deal with the pain of the loss of my grandfather and also just not being comfortable in who I am. I ate away my emotions. Food was a comfort when I didn’t want to go online. I hated how I looked and felt and was  just a mess. This feeling of inadequacy also hurt my relationships. I felt like everyone was picking on me. I felt like it was the world against Mya and I began to ask God why can’t I be like someone else? I’d dream about my life as a different person; a different weight, skin complexion (I also had acne at this time) just different anything other than me. I retreated and didn’t want to talk about anything. I was unhappy being me. It’s hard to be something you have never seen.</p><br>
										<p>I didn’t know me neither did I love me then. It wasn’t until my final quarter as an 8th grader where the mess hit the fan and I truly broke my mother’s heart with what I did and too see her in that much pain I knew that I needed to change. And so I reached out to God and prayed to for Him to help me see me the way He sees me. I said I don’t want to go into high school like this. And He answered me. After that pivotal moment God allowed for me to go on my school’s winter trip to Washington D.C. and that's when it changed for me. My “ahah” moment literally came after our trip to the Holocaust museum. I saw the memorials and the stories of the children and families torn apart by such hatred and malice and intolerance of difference that I knew I could not be the same. I did not want to live my life being intolerant of my difference. So I made the change. God began to work on me and I began to lose the weight. I lost the weight but I still wasn’t happy. I no longer indulged in pornography but I still wasn’t happy. So I went onto high school still with that void of not knowing me and still searching for that thing to fill the void. It wasn’t until 9th grade that God flipped my life upside down and really began to show me ... me. </p><br>
										<p>I lost my friends who I thought were my friends but who really weren’t good for me because they were negative and not truly committed to bettering themselves like I was. In that desperation of wanting to fit in and have that companionship, I was blind to their true nature. Desperation causes blindness; an inability to release toxicity including the people who are not good for you. I was lonely but not alone. I had no one but God and He worked with me. I sat by myself at lunch for the remainder of the year and studied the Word. He was showing me who I was. My sophomore year was when I finally got that epiphany that I was beautiful. I had started to invest in self care and took up painting my nails and feet. So I sat one Saturday night in my room doing my nails listening to Jhene Aiko’s “The Worst” and I feel this wind come over me and I just stopped and said “I’m beautiful “ and I believed what I said. It’s an experience one has to go through themselves to truly understand the gravity of that moment but I finally realized I was truly beautiful and I began to see my worth and value. That moment my perception of self changed. I still struggled with the low self esteem but it wasn’t how it used to be. I began saying certain affirmations, such as “I am beautiful... I am loved” and I began to see the difference. I began to walk different and talk different. I no longer allowed certain things or people in my life to dictate how I should or should not be. My remaining high school years were about breaking down the false ideas of myself. I realized I don’t have to fit in to be loved. I can just be and with that I had to leave a lot of friends behind. But I still grappled with that loneliness. So I found a new method to numb the pain via academics. I was always an intelligent kid but I decided to become the best too prove that I am worthy and that I didn’t need anybody else because I felt I was better because I was so smart. With my intelligence I noticed people would pay attention to me and notice me —mainly because they wanted my help with something but I didn’t care. I was so excited that they  saw me and talked to me. It didn't matter they only came to take something and leave me behind. I allowed myself to be abused. Allowing others to take advantage of you is abuse. So I allowed for that to happen I allowed people to use me and take advantage of me. I didn’t see my worth wholly and fully yet.  I was not confident to stand up for myself yet. Interestingly enough, I saw others trying to fit in and I saw how silly they looked in doing so but in my judgement I had forgotten that I was no different. I was trying to fit in and be seen and loved also. Isn't it funny how we see what’s wrong with others but can’t see the problem in us ? I wrestled with that until I finally left for college. After much reminiscence and introspection over the summer, I finally understood  like yeah I am something,  I do matter, and I am worthy to be whoever I am meant to be regardless if others “see” me or not. After leaving for college is when I found myself. I found myself to be in love with me. I found myself to be in love with how I looked and how I laughed and what made me light up. I found me, away from all that I had known and seen. I had moved to NY to go to school for my first year. Away from all that I had known I finally found me. I saw that I had been living a lie. I was tainting myself by hiding who I truly was and ignoring the pull to be who I was truly meant to be. I found myself!</p><br>
										<p>So here I am living my life and loving me. Every part of me. In my time alone with God I had to own my past and own my pain and own the hurt I caused myself and others. I had to own it and then forgive myself and then release the pain and the mistakes to receive that brand new beginning He had for me. That’s the thing with being authentic. It’s about owning all of you. Every mistake, every flaw, and every thing you wished you could change. Owning and being ok with how your life had turned out to be. Owning you and all your quirks. You have to go inward and see where you not only went wrong but what circumstances you allowed to tell you who you are. Through all of this I found who I wasn’t and all that wasn’t me. Pornography that wasn’t me, low self esteem that wasn’t me, doing the maximum and being inauthentic to be seen in school, that wasn’t me.So how did I get here?</p><br>
										<p>By loving me as the Divine loves me, removing all that wasn’t me and accepting my truth as authentically as can be. I am here because I am me. Unadulteratedly me. It was scary. There were times I didn’t like what I had come to see in me... but God healed me and delivered me from all manner of deception of who I was supposed to be by society’s standards. I am me. I am light. I am love.</p><br>
										<p>After all of that hard work came restoration. My relationship with food had been healed—I’m no longer an emotional eater, my familial relationships had been healed, my skin cleared, and I am finally in love with being me. I now know what it is to be me and when I am being loved. It was a long journey but I love me. I accepted my past and my pain and used that as part of my story. I don't hide those parts of me anymore because they shaped me. That void of not being loved and trying to fit in is filled with the love and light of God and my authentic being.</p><br>
										<p>I am no where near finished with my journey and I certainly don’t have all the answers but I do know that once you take that leap to discover you, your authentic self, your life will never be the same. It’s scary but step out of that fear and make the change. The journey to finding you is miraculous and life changing you will discover things you never thought could be in you and you will and can overcome the pain of your past. I know because I did. God completely changed my life and I began living my best life ,but it all started with wanting to answer the question: How did I get here? So don't be afraid to go inward, feel all that is revealed and release it. All that is true is waiting to come out! Welcome the authentic you! <strong>And so it is!</strong></p>
